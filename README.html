<p>The <em>flitetrakr/data</em> folder contains two files (namely <em>connections-1.txt</em> and <em>connections-2.txt</em>). For each scenario represented by these files, I pasted the corresponding directed graph and a output collected from command line.  </p>

<p>This file is a directed graph extracted from a text book. The following listing shows a couple of interesting queries.</p>
<pre><code>$ java -jar target/flitetrakr-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar  data/connections-1.txt
1: What is the cheapest connection from A to E ?
1: A-B-D-E-4

2: What is the price of the connection A-X-C-D-E?
2: 12

3: How many different connections with maximum 3 stops exist between X and E?
3: 3

4: How many different connections with maximum 2 stops exist between X and E?
4: 2

5: How many different connections with exactly 3 stop exists between A and E?
5: 3

6: How many different connections with minimum 4 stop exists between A and Y?
6: 2

7: How many different connections with minimum 2 stop exists between X and Y?
7: 3

8: Find all connections from A to E below 7 Euros!
8: A-B-D-E-4, A-C-D-E-6

9: Find all connections from A to E below 6 Euros!
9: A-B-D-E-4

10: Find all connections from A to E below 4 Euros!
10: No such connection found!

<p>This file contains the sample input and questions found in the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/adigsd/backend-flitetrakr">challenge page</a>. All answers match except <em>#7</em>; in this case the challenge answer is <strong>2</strong> whilst program output is <strong>1</strong>. However, if we ask the application to take into account repeated stops at the same place (by setting <strong>-Dcom.assessment.flitetrakr.multiple=true</strong>), we get a perfect match. Check the next two listings in order to catch the situation.</p>

</code></pre><p>Since all links between two airports are unidirectional (as implied by the connection format <strong>&lt;code-of-departure-airport&gt;-&lt;code-of-arrival-airport&gt;-&lt;price-in-euro&gt;</strong>), it is quite straight forward to understand why question #7 yield different answers by just taking a look at the directed graph.</p>
